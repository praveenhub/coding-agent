## How to Build a Code-Editing Agent in Python with Gemini

**(or: It's Easier Than You Think!)**

*Adapted from Thorsten Ball's "How to Build an Agent"*
*Current Date: Tuesday, April 15, 2025*

It seems magical, doesn't it? Watching a coding agent browse files, write code, fix errors, and try different approaches feels like witnessing some deeply complex AI sorcery. You might think there's a hidden, intricate mechanism powering it all.

Spoiler alert: **There isn't.**

At its core, a functional code-editing agent often boils down to three things:

1.  A powerful Large Language Model (LLM).
2.  A loop that keeps the conversation going.
3.  The ability for the LLM to use "tools" to interact with the outside world (like your file system).

Everything else ‚Äì the slick UIs, the fancy error recovery, the context-awareness that makes tools like Google's Project IDX or GitHub Copilot Workspace so impressive ‚Äì is often built upon this foundation with clever prompting, robust engineering, and yes, a good amount of "elbow grease."

But you don't need all that complexity to build something *genuinely impressive*. You can create a capable agent, right here, right now, in surprisingly few lines of Python code.

**I strongly encourage you to code along.** Reading is one thing, but *feeling* how little code it takes to achieve this is another. Seeing it run in your own terminal, modifying your own files? That's where the "aha!" moment happens.

**Here‚Äôs what you'll need:**

1.  **Python 3.7+** installed.
2.  A **Google AI Studio API Key** for the Gemini API. You can get one for free [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
3.  Set your API key as an environment variable named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

Ready? Let's dive in.

### Step 1: Project Setup and Basic Chat Loop

First, let's get our project environment ready. Open your terminal:

```bash
# Create and navigate to the project directory
mkdir python-gemini-agent
cd python-gemini-agent

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Create main file and requirements file
touch main.py requirements.txt

# Create a placeholder for your API key (or set it directly)
echo "export GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'" > .envrc # Optional: if you use direnv
# Remember to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' and potentially source the file
# Or set it directly in your shell: export GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
```

Now, let's install the necessary library: the Google Generative AI SDK. Add this line to `requirements.txt`:

```text
# requirements.txt
google-genai
```

And install it:

```bash
pip install google-genai
```

> **Note:** The previous SDK (`google-generativeai`) is deprecated. Use `google-genai` for all new projects. See [Gemini API Libraries](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/libraries) for details.


Next, open `main.py` and put in the basic structure. We'll create a simple `Agent` class to hold our logic.

```python
# main.py
from google import genai
from google.genai import types
import os
import sys
from pathlib import Path
import json

# --- Configuration ---
# Load the API key from environment variable
try:
    GOOGLE_API_KEY = os.environ['GOOGLE_API_KEY']
    client = genai.Client()  # Uses GOOGLE_API_KEY from environment, or pass api_key="..."
except KeyError:
    print("üõë Error: GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable not set.")
    sys.exit(1)

# Choose your Gemini model
MODEL_NAME = "gemini-2.0-flash" # Or "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25"

# --- Agent Class ---
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, model_name: str):
        print(f"‚ú® Initializing Agent with model: {model_name}")
        # We'll initialize the model later, when we know about tools
        self.model_name = model_name
        self.model = None # Placeholder
        self.chat = None # Placeholder for the chat session

    def _initialize_chat(self, tools: list | None = None):
        """Initializes or re-initializes the model and chat session."""
        print(f"üîÑ Initializing model and chat (Tools: {'Yes' if tools else 'No'})...")
        self.chat = client.chats.create(model=self.model_name)
print("‚úÖ Chat initialized.")


    def run(self):
        """Starts the main interaction loop."""
        self._initialize_chat() # Initialize without tools first

        print("\nüí¨ Chat with Gemini (type 'quit' or 'exit' to end)")
        print("-" * 30)

        while True:
            try:
                user_input = input("üîµ \x1b[94mYou:\x1b[0m ") # Blue text for user
                if user_input.lower() in ["quit", "exit"]:
                    print("üëã Goodbye!")
                    break

                if not user_input:
                    continue

                # Send message to Gemini
                print("üß† Thinking...")
                response = self.chat.send_message(user_input)

                # Print Gemini's response
                # Note: Automatic function calling handles tool calls implicitly here!
                # We'll need to adjust this later when we manually handle tools.
                text_response = response.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text
print(f"üü† \x1b[93mGemini:\x1b[0m {text_response}") # Orange text for Gemini

            except KeyboardInterrupt:
                print("\nüëã Interrupted. Goodbye!")
                break
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"üõë An error occurred: {e}")
                # Consider whether to break or continue on error
                # break


# --- Main Execution ---
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = Agent(MODEL_NAME)
    agent.run()
```

**What's happening here?**

1.  **Import necessary libraries:** `google.generativeai` for the API, `os` for environment variables, `sys` for exit, `pathlib` for file paths (we'll use it later), and `json` for tool data.
2.  **Configure API Key:** Reads the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from your environment. Crucial!
3.  **`Agent` Class:** A simple container for our logic.
    * `__init__`: Sets up the model name.
    * `_initialize_chat`: Configures the `genai.GenerativeModel` and starts a `ChatSession`. Notice the `tools` parameter ‚Äì we'll use this soon. We also set `enable_automatic_function_calling=True`, which is the easiest way to get started with Gemini tools.
    * `run`: The main loop. It gets user input, sends it to `self.chat.send_message()`, and prints the `response.text`.

**üß™ Quick Test #1: Basic Conversation**

Make sure your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set in your environment. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see:

```
‚ú® Initializing Agent with model: gemini-1.5-flash-latest
üîÑ Initializing model and chat (Tools: No)...
‚úÖ Model and chat initialized.

üí¨ Chat with Gemini (type 'quit' or 'exit' to end)
------------------------------
üîµ You: Hi Gemini! How are you today?
üß† Thinking...
üü† Gemini: I'm doing great! Ready to help with anything you need. How can I assist you today?
üîµ You: quit
üëã Goodbye!
```

If this works, your basic connection to the Gemini API is successful! This is the foundation of *every* AI chat application. Notice Gemini maintains context within the `self.chat` session implicitly.

### Step 2: Understanding and Implementing Tools

An "agent" becomes truly powerful when the LLM can interact with the world outside its text window. This is done via **tools** (often called "function calling" in API terms).

**The Concept:**

1.  **Define Tools:** You tell the LLM about available tools: their names, what they do, and what input parameters they expect.
2.  **LLM Request:** When the LLM thinks a tool can help answer the user's query, instead of just generating text, it generates a special message asking to call that tool with specific arguments.
3.  **Execute Tool:** Your code detects this request, extracts the tool name and arguments, runs the actual tool code (e.g., reading a file), and gets the result.
4.  **Send Result:** You send the tool's result back to the LLM.
5.  **LLM Response:** The LLM uses the tool's result to formulate its final text response to the user.

**Gemini API Tool Structure (New SDK):**

With the new SDK, you simply define Python functions as your tools and register them directly with the client. No more FunctionDeclaration or Tool objects!

```python
# Example tool function
def read_file(path: str) -> str:
    """Reads the content of a file at the given relative path."""
    print(f"üõ†Ô∏è Executing read_file tool with path: {path}")
    try:
        file_path = Path(path).resolve()
        if not file_path.is_relative_to(Path.cwd()):
            return f"Error: Path '{path}' is outside the project directory."
        if not file_path.is_file():
            return f"Error: Path '{path}' is not a file or does not exist."
        return file_path.read_text(encoding='utf-8')
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error reading file '{path}': {e}"

# Register your tool(s) with the chat config
chat = client.chats.create(
    model=MODEL_NAME,
    config=types.ChatSessionConfig(
        tools=[read_file],  # Add more tool functions here as needed
    )
)
```

Now, when Gemini wants to use a tool, it will call your Python function directly!
my_tool = Tool(
    function_declarations=[
        FunctionDeclaration(
            name="tool_name_here",
            description="What this tool does.",
            parameters={ # OpenAPI Schema format
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "param1": {"type": "string", "description": "Desc for param1"},
                    "param2": {"type": "integer", "description": "Desc for param2"}
                },
                "required": ["param1"] # Which parameters are mandatory
            }
        )
    ]
)
```

### Step 3: Implementing the `read_file` Tool (New SDK)

Let's give our agent the ability to read files. With the new SDK, just define a Python function and register it as a tool.

**1. Define the Tool Function:**

Add this Python function *before* the `Agent` class definition in `main.py`:

```python
# --- Tool Functions ---

def read_file(path: str) -> str:
    """
    Reads the content of a file at the given relative path.

    Args:
        path: The relative path to the file.

    Returns:
        The content of the file as a string, or an error message.
    """
    print(f"üõ†Ô∏è Executing read_file tool with path: {path}")
    try:
        file_path = Path(path).resolve() # Resolve to absolute path for security/clarity
        # Basic security check: ensure file is within the project directory
        if not file_path.is_relative_to(Path.cwd()):
             raise SecurityError(f"Access denied: Path '{path}' is outside the project directory.")

        if not file_path.is_file():
            return f"Error: Path '{path}' is not a file or does not exist."
        content = file_path.read_text(encoding='utf-8')
        print(f"‚úÖ read_file successful for: {path}")
        return content
    except SecurityError as e:
        print(f"üö® Security Error in read_file: {e}")
        return f"Error: {e}"
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"üõë Error in read_file for '{path}': {e}")
        return f"Error reading file '{path}': {e}"

class SecurityError(Exception):
    """Custom exception for security violations."""
    pass

# --- No tool declaration needed in new SDK! ---
# Just pass your function directly to the tools argument.
```

* We define a standard Python function `read_file` that takes a `path`.
* It uses `pathlib` for robust path handling.
* **Important:** It includes a basic security check (`is_relative_to(Path.cwd())`) to prevent the agent from reading files outside the project directory. You might want more sophisticated checks in a real application.
* It returns the file content or an error message.

**2. Integrate Tools into the Agent:**

Now, register your tool with the chat session:

```python
# main.py
# ... (imports and tool function definition) ...

from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()
MODEL_NAME = "gemini-2.0-flash"  # Or another Gemini model

chat = client.chats.create(
    model=MODEL_NAME,
    config=types.ChatSessionConfig(
        tools=[read_file],
    )
)

# Now you can send messages and Gemini will call your tool as needed!
```

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, model_name: str):
        print(f"‚ú® Initializing Agent with model: {model_name}")
        self.model_name = model_name
        self.model = None
        self.chat = None
        # Store tool functions and their definitions
        self.tools = {
            "read_file": read_file
            # Add more tools here later
        }
        self.tool_definitions = [
            READ_FILE_TOOL
            # Add more tool definitions here later
        ]

    def _initialize_chat(self): # Removed tools argument, uses self.tool_definitions
        """Initializes or re-initializes the model and chat session."""
        print(f"üîÑ Initializing model and chat (Tools: {'Yes' if self.tool_definitions else 'No'})...")
        self.model = genai.GenerativeModel(
            self.model_name,
            # system_instruction="You are a helpful coding assistant.",
            tools=self.tool_definitions # Use the agent's tool definitions
        )
        # IMPORTANT: Keep automatic function calling enabled for now
        self.chat = self.model.start_chat(enable_automatic_function_calling=True)
        print("‚úÖ Model and chat initialized.")

    def run(self):
        """Starts the main interaction loop."""
        # Initialize with the tools defined in __init__
        self._initialize_chat()

        print("\nüí¨ Chat with Gemini (type 'quit' or 'exit' to end)")
        print("-" * 30)

        while True:
            try:
                user_input = input("üîµ \x1b[94mYou:\x1b[0m ")
                if user_input.lower() in ["quit", "exit"]:
                    print("üëã Goodbye!")
                    break
                if not user_input:
                    continue

                print("üß† Thinking...")
                response = self.chat.send_message(user_input)

                # Automatic function calling handles the back-and-forth
                # internally when enable_automatic_function_calling=True.
                # The final response.text will incorporate the tool's result.
                text_response = response.text
                print(f"üü† \x1b[93mGemini:\x1b[0m {text_response}")

            except KeyboardInterrupt:
                print("\nüëã Interrupted. Goodbye!")
                break
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"üõë An error occurred: {e}")
                # Decide if you want to break or continue

# ... (SecurityError class and Main Execution) ...
```

**Changes:**

1.  **`__init__`:** Stores the actual Python function `read_file` in `self.tools` (a dictionary mapping name to function) and its `FunctionDeclaration` in `self.tool_definitions` (a list).
2.  **`_initialize_chat`:** Now uses `self.tool_definitions` when creating the `GenerativeModel`.
3.  **`run`:** The loop remains simple for now because `enable_automatic_function_calling=True` handles the tool execution flow magically behind the scenes! The SDK detects the function call request from Gemini, finds the matching function name in the `tools` list provided to the model, calls *your* Python function (`read_file` in this case) with the arguments Gemini provided, sends the result back, and gives you the final text response.

**üß™ Quick Test #2: Using `read_file`**

1.  Create a dummy file in your project directory:

    ```bash
    echo "This is the content of my test file." > my_test_file.txt
    ```

2.  Make sure your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set and run the agent:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3.  Interact with the agent:

    ```
    ‚ú® Initializing Agent with model: gemini-1.5-flash-latest
    üîÑ Initializing model and chat (Tools: Yes)...
    ‚úÖ Model and chat initialized.

    üí¨ Chat with Gemini (type 'quit' or 'exit' to end)
    ------------------------------
    üîµ You: what is in the file named my_test_file.txt?
    üß† Thinking...
    üõ†Ô∏è Executing read_file tool with path: my_test_file.txt  # <-- You should see this!
    ‚úÖ read_file successful for: my_test_file.txt
    üü† Gemini: The file `my_test_file.txt` contains the following text:
    This is the content of my test file.
    üîµ You: Thanks! Now tell me what's in main.py
    üß† Thinking...
    üõ†Ô∏è Executing read_file tool with path: main.py
    ‚úÖ read_file successful for: main.py
    üü† Gemini: Okay, I've read the `main.py` file. It appears to be a Python script that sets up a conversational agent using the Google Generative AI SDK (Gemini). It defines an `Agent` class with methods to initialize the AI model, handle a chat loop, and includes a `read_file` tool function allowing the agent to read local files. The script configures the Gemini API key from an environment variable and starts the agent's interaction loop when run.
    üîµ You: Try reading /etc/passwd
    üß† Thinking...
    üõ†Ô∏è Executing read_file tool with path: /etc/passwd
    üö® Security Error in read_file: Access denied: Path '/etc/passwd' is outside the project directory.
    üü† Gemini: Error: Access denied: Path '/etc/passwd' is outside the project directory. # <-- Good! Security worked.
    üîµ You: quit
    üëã Goodbye!
    ```

Success! You see the `üõ†Ô∏è Executing read_file...` log message, proving your Python function was called. The agent correctly read the file and used its content to answer. The security check also prevented reading outside the project.

*(Note: If you want finer control over the tool calling process, you can set `enable_automatic_function_calling=False` and manually handle the `response.function_calls` attribute, execute the tool, and send back a `FunctionResponse`. The automatic mode is simpler for this example.)*

### Step 4: Adding More Tools: `list_files`

Let's give the agent the ability to see what files are in a directory, similar to the `ls` command.

**1. Define the Tool Function:**

Add this *before* the `Agent` class:

```python
# main.py
# ... (imports, read_file function) ...

def list_files(path: str = ".") -> str:
    """
    Lists files and directories within a given relative path.

    Args:
        path: The relative path of the directory to list. Defaults to the current directory.

    Returns:
        A JSON string representing a list of files and directories,
        with directories indicated by a trailing slash, or an error message.
    """
    print(f"üõ†Ô∏è Executing list_files tool with path: {path}")
    base_path = Path(path).resolve()
    try:
         # Security check
        if not base_path.is_relative_to(Path.cwd()):
            raise SecurityError(f"Access denied: Path '{path}' is outside the project directory.")

        if not base_path.is_dir():
            return f"Error: Path '{path}' is not a directory or does not exist."

        items = []
        for item in base_path.iterdir():
            # Construct relative path from CWD for consistent view
            relative_item_path = item.relative_to(Path.cwd())
            if item.is_dir():
                items.append(f"{relative_item_path}/")
            else:
                items.append(str(relative_item_path))

        print(f"‚úÖ list_files successful for: {path}")
        return json.dumps(items) # Return as JSON list

    except SecurityError as e:
        print(f"üö® Security Error in list_files: {e}")
        return f"Error: {e}"
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"üõë Error in list_files for '{path}': {e}")
        return f"Error listing files in '{path}': {e}"

# Tool Definition
LIST_FILES_TOOL = FunctionDeclaration(
    name="list_files",
    description="List files and directories within a given relative path from the current working directory. Defaults to the current directory if no path is provided. Directories have a trailing '/'",
    parameters={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "path": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Optional relative path of the directory to list (e.g., 'src/', '.'). Defaults to current directory."
            }
        },
        # No required parameters, 'path' is optional
    }
)

# ... (SecurityError class) ...
```

* Uses `pathlib` again.
* Includes the same security check.
* Defaults to the current directory (`.`) if no path is given.
* Returns a **JSON string** containing a list of file/directory names. Directories have a trailing `/`. This structured format is often easier for the LLM to parse reliably than plain text.

**2. Add to the Agent:**

Modify the `Agent.__init__` method:

```python
# main.py
# ... (imports, tool functions, tool declarations) ...

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, model_name: str):
        print(f"‚ú® Initializing Agent with model: {model_name}")
        self.model_name = model_name
        self.model = None
        self.chat = None
        # Store tool functions and their definitions
        self.tools = {
            "read_file": read_file,
            "list_files": list_files # <--- ADD THIS
            # Add more tools here later
        }
        self.tool_definitions = [
            READ_FILE_TOOL,
            LIST_FILES_TOOL # <--- ADD THIS
            # Add more tool definitions here later
        ]
        # The rest of the class remains the same...

    # ... (_initialize_chat, run methods) ...

# ... (SecurityError class and Main Execution) ...
```

**üß™ Quick Test #3: Using `list_files` and Combining Tools**

Run the agent again: `python main.py`

```

üü† Gemini: The main Python file found is `main.py`. It sets up a Gemini-based chat agent with the capability to read local files (`read_file` tool) and list directory contents (`list_files` tool). It uses the `google-generativeai` library and handles user interaction in a loop.

üîµ You: quit
üëã Goodbye!
```

Fantastic! The agent first used `list_files` to see `main.py`, then used `read_file` to examine it, just like a human would. It's combining tools to fulfill a more complex request.

### Step 5: The Grand Finale: The `edit_file` Tool

This is where it gets really interesting. Let's allow the agent to modify files.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** Giving an AI write access to your file system is inherently risky. The simple string replacement method here is less dangerous than arbitrary code execution, but still, *use with caution, especially outside this controlled example*. The security checks are minimal.

**1. Define the Tool Function:**

This implementation uses a simple, yet surprisingly effective, string replacement strategy. It's not as robust as diff/patch or AST manipulation but works well for many common edits LLMs suggest.

Add this *before* the `Agent` class:

```python
# main.py
# ... (imports, other tool functions/declarations) ...

def edit_file(path: str, old_str: str, new_str: str) -> str:
    """
    Edits a file by replacing the first occurrence of old_str with new_str.
    Creates the file (and directories) if it doesn't exist and old_str is empty.

    Args:
        path: The relative path to the file.
        old_str: The exact string to search for. If empty, new_str is prepended/file created.
        new_str: The string to replace old_str with.

    Returns:
        "OK" on success, or an error message.
    """
    print(f"üõ†Ô∏è Executing edit_file: Replacing '{old_str[:50]}...' with '{new_str[:50]}...' in '{path}'")
    if old_str == new_str:
        return "Error: old_str and new_str must be different."

    file_path = Path(path).resolve()
    try:
        # Security check
        if not file_path.is_relative_to(Path.cwd()):
             raise SecurityError(f"Access denied: Path '{path}' is outside the project directory.")

        if file_path.exists():
            if not file_path.is_file():
                 return f"Error: Path '{path}' exists but is not a file."
            original_content = file_path.read_text(encoding='utf-8')
            if old_str == "": # Prepend if old_str is empty
                 new_content = new_str + original_content
            else:
                if old_str not in original_content:
                    return f"Error: '{old_str[:100]}...' not found in the file '{path}'. Cannot edit."
                # Replace only the first occurrence for more predictable edits
                new_content = original_content.replace(old_str, new_str, 1)
            print("   File exists, attempting replacement.")
        elif old_str == "": # File doesn't exist, create it only if old_str is empty
            print("   File does not exist, creating...")
            # Create parent directories if they don't exist
            file_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
            new_content = new_str
        else: # File doesn't exist, and old_str is not empty
             return f"Error: File '{path}' does not exist and old_str is not empty. Cannot replace text in non-existent file."

        # Write the modified content back
        file_path.write_text(new_content, encoding='utf-8')
        print(f"‚úÖ edit_file successful for: {path}")
        return "OK" # Simple success message

    except SecurityError as e:
        print(f"üö® Security Error in edit_file: {e}")
        return f"Error: {e}"
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"üõë Error in edit_file for '{path}': {e}")
        return f"Error editing file '{path}': {e}"


# Tool Definition
EDIT_FILE_TOOL = FunctionDeclaration(
    name="edit_file",
    description="Edits a file by replacing the first exact occurrence of 'old_str' with 'new_str'. If 'old_str' is an empty string (''), 'new_str' is prepended to the file. If the file doesn't exist, it's created only if 'old_str' is empty.",
    parameters={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "path": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The relative path of the file to edit (e.g., 'src/code.js', 'config.txt')."
            },
            "old_str": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The exact text snippet to search for. Must match exactly. Use '' to prepend or create a new file."
            },
             "new_str": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The text snippet to replace 'old_str' with."
            }
        },
        "required": ["path", "old_str", "new_str"]
    }
)

# ... (SecurityError class) ...
```

* Takes `path`, `old_str`, `new_str`.
* **Crucially:** If `old_str` is empty (`""`), it treats it as a request to create the file (if it doesn't exist) or prepend content (if it does). This is a common pattern LLMs can use for creation.
* If `old_str` is *not* empty, it requires the file to exist and `old_str` to be present. It replaces only the *first* occurrence (`.replace(..., 1)`). This makes edits less likely to go haywire if the `old_str` appears multiple times unexpectedly.
* Creates parent directories if needed (`file_path.parent.mkdir`).

**2. Add to the Agent:**

Modify `Agent.__init__`:

```python
# main.py
# ... (imports, tool functions, tool declarations) ...

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, model_name: str):
        print(f"‚ú® Initializing Agent with model: {model_name}")
        # ... (model_name, model, chat setup) ...
        self.tools = {
            "read_file": read_file,
            "list_files": list_files,
            "edit_file": edit_file # <--- ADD THIS
        }
        self.tool_definitions = [
            READ_FILE_TOOL,
            LIST_FILES_TOOL,
            EDIT_FILE_TOOL # <--- ADD THIS
        ]
        # ... (rest of __init__) ...

    # ... (_initialize_chat, run methods) ...

# ... (SecurityError class and Main Execution) ...
```

**üß™ Quick Test #4: Creating and Editing Files**

Let's put it through its paces. Run `python main.py`.

**Scenario 1: Create a FizzBuzz script**

```
üîµ You: create a python script named fizzbuzz.py that prints fizzbuzz from 1 to 20 and then runs itself.
üß† Thinking...
üõ†Ô∏è Executing edit_file: Replacing ''... with '#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n"""\nFizzBuzz implementation in Python.\nPrints numbers from 1 to 20, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz",\nmultiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".\n"""\n\ndef fizzbuzz(n):\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        output = \'\'\n        if i % 3 == 0:\n            output += \'Fizz\'\n        if i % 5 == 0:\n            output += \'Buzz\'\n        print(output or i)\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    print("Running FizzBuzz up to 20:")\n    fizzbuzz(20)\n'... in 'fizzbuzz.py' # <-- Tool called with empty old_str
   File does not exist, creating...
‚úÖ edit_file successful for: fizzbuzz.py
üü† Gemini: OK. I have created the `fizzbuzz.py` script. It defines a `fizzbuzz` function and prints the sequence from 1 to 20 when executed.

You can run it from your terminal using: `python fizzbuzz.py`
```

*Check:* A `fizzbuzz.py` file should now exist in your directory! Run it:

```bash
python fizzbuzz.py
```

You should see the FizzBuzz output up to 20. It worked!

**Scenario 2: Edit the FizzBuzz script**

```
üîµ You: please edit fizzbuzz.py so it only prints up to 10 instead of 20
üß† Thinking...
üõ†Ô∏è Executing read_file tool with path: fizzbuzz.py # <-- Reads first to understand
‚úÖ read_file successful for: fizzbuzz.py
üõ†Ô∏è Executing edit_file: Replacing 'fizzbuzz(20)'... with 'fizzbuzz(10)'... in 'fizzbuzz.py' # <-- Edits the number
   File exists, attempting replacement.
‚úÖ edit_file successful for: fizzbuzz.py
üõ†Ô∏è Executing edit_file: Replacing 'Running FizzBuzz up to 20:'... with 'Running FizzBuzz up to 10:'... in 'fizzbuzz.py' # <-- Edits the print statement
   File exists, attempting replacement.
‚úÖ edit_file successful for: fizzbuzz.py
üõ†Ô∏è Executing edit_file: Replacing 'Prints numbers from 1 to 20,'... with 'Prints numbers from 1 to 10,'... in 'fizzbuzz.py' # <-- Even edits the docstring!
   File exists, attempting replacement.
‚úÖ edit_file successful for: fizzbuzz.py
üü† Gemini: OK, I've edited the `fizzbuzz.py` script. It will now print the FizzBuzz sequence only up to 10 instead of 20. I also updated the relevant comment and print statement to reflect this change.
```

*Check:* Run `python fizzbuzz.py` again. It should now only print up to 10. The agent read the file, identified the necessary changes (including in comments!), and used the `edit_file` tool multiple times.

**Scenario 3: A slightly more complex request (ROT13 Decode)**

```
üîµ You: Create a python script congrats.py that rot13 decodes the string 'Pbatenghyngvbaf ba ohvyqvat n clguba ntrag!' and prints the result.
üß† Thinking...
üõ†Ô∏è Executing edit_file: Replacing ''... with '#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport codecs\n\n"""\nDecodes a ROT13 encoded string and prints the result.\n"""\n\ndef rot13_decode(encoded_string):\n    return codecs.decode(encoded_string, \'rot_13\')\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    encoded = \'Pbatenghyngvbaf ba ohvyqvat n clguba ntrag!\'\n    decoded = rot13_decode(encoded)\n    print(decoded)\n'... in 'congrats.py'
   File does not exist, creating...
‚úÖ edit_file successful for: congrats.py
üü† Gemini: OK, I have created the `congrats.py` script. It uses the `codecs` module to perform ROT13 decoding on the provided string and print the result.

You can run it using: `python congrats.py`
```

*Check:* Run `python congrats.py`. It should print:

```
Congratulations on building a python agent!
```

It does!

### Conclusion: The Emperor Has No Clothes (Just an LLM, a Loop, and Tools)

If you followed along, you now have a functioning, file-reading, file-listing, *code-editing* agent built with Python and the Gemini API. And how much code was it really? Excluding comments and blank lines, likely under 200 lines.

This is the fundamental loop. The "magic" is largely the incredible capability of modern LLMs like Gemini to understand requests, plan steps, and correctly utilize the tools you provide. They are trained for this!

Of course, building a production-ready agent involves more:

* **Robust Error Handling:** What if a tool fails? What if the LLM gets stuck in a loop?
* **Better Editing:** Using diff/patch or Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for more reliable code changes.
* **Context Management:** Providing more relevant context (e.g., open files in an IDE, project structure).
* **Planning & Reasoning:** More sophisticated prompts or multi-step agent frameworks (like ReAct or LangChain/LlamaIndex agents) for complex tasks.
* **Sandboxing:** Safely executing code generated by the LLM.
* **User Interface:** Integrating into editors or chat interfaces.

But the core mechanism? You just built it. It's an LLM, a loop, and tools. The rest is engineering.

These models are powerful. Go experiment! See how far you can push this simple agent. Ask it to refactor code, add features, write tests. You might be surprised by how capable it already is. The landscape of software development *is* changing, and you now have a foundational understanding of how these agents work under the hood.

Congratulations on building a Python agent!
